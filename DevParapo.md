# DevParapo

## Date: Friday, January 30, 2015
## Venue: Co-Creation Hub Nigeria

### Ecosystem Meetup

**Event Deescription:** Attracting and finding the right tech talent to bolster your teamâ€™s capabilities is a herculean task in light of the gaping disconnect between graduates from Nigerian universities, polytechnics and technical/ design schools and the reality of the work that we need them to do.



Growing our local tech ecosystem without commensurate, concerted effort to increase the pool of tech talent available means that there will be difficulty in finding more people to run your organisation with as you grow.
